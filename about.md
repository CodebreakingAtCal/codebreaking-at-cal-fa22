## About

The Codebreaking at Cal DeCal is designed to provide an introduction to the field of cryptography. This course will focus on real-world examples to teach the mathematics and computer science behind the field. Students will develop both practical and theoretical skills to approach a wide variety of cryptographic challenges in the labs.

This is **technical DeCal**, so expect a moderate level of workload.
## Prerequisites
We **stricly require** CS 70 and CS 61A (or equivalent discrete math, probability, and Python programming experience). If you think you have the equivalent background, 
please note so on the enrollment form.

Helpful, but not required: CS 161, CS 170, MATH 113, MATH 116

## Grading
You are required to attend at least **10** lectures, complete **8** labs, pass **8** homeworks, and complete the final project to pass. We do not want to (or plan to) fail anyone, so please reach out to staff if you want extensions/need help!

## Attendance
Each week's lecture will have an attendance link shown at the end. Filling this out and getting at least 50% correct on the questions in the form will credit you with attendance for the week. This form must be filled out during/immediately after lecture, but both in-person and Zoom attendance counts the same.

## Labs
Each week will have a Jupyter Notebook lab to complete. These are entirely autograded, with no hidden tests. Once you have passed all the local tests, submit them to Gradescope per the notebook instructions to receive credit for that week.

## Homework
Each week will also have a short problem set to complete. This can be handwritten or typed. A pass will count as a score >60%, though this may change on a weekly basis. Grading will be lenient, so a good effort on the homework will almost certainly be enough to pass for the week.

## Final Project
There will be a final project announced near the end of the semester. Students are required to complete both parts to an acceptable score (TBD later). You will most likely have 3-4 weeks to complete this, and it won't be nearly the same workload as a normal CS class project.
