## About

The Codebreaking at Cal DeCal is designed to provide an introduction to the field of cryptography. This course will focus on real-world examples to teach the mathematics and computer science behind the field. Students will develop both practical and theoretical skills to approach a wide variety of cryptographic challenges in the labs.

This is **technical DeCal**, so expect a moderate level of workload (on par with a CS class minus exams and homework).
## Prerequisites
We **stricly require** CS 70 and CS 61A (or equivalent discrete math, probability, and Python programming experience). If you think you have the equivalent background, 
please note so on the enrollment form.

Helpful, but not required: CS 161, CS 170, MATH 113, MATH 116

## Grading
You are required to attend at least **10** lectures (or equivalent), complete **8** labs, and complete the final project to pass. 

## Attendance
Each week's lecture will have an attendance link shown at the end. Filling this out and getting at least 50% correct on the questions in the form will credit you with attendance for the week. This form must be filled out during/immediately after lecture, but both in-person and Zoom attendance counts the same.

Students may complete the **challenge assignment** for that week as an alternative to going to lecture. Completing the prescribed challenges will count as attendance for the week.
## Labs
Each week will have a Jupyter Notebook lab to complete. These are entirely autograded, with no hidden tests. Once you have passed all the local tests, submit them to Gradescope per the notebook instructions to receive credit for that week.

## Final Project
There will be a final project involving designing, building, and hacking into a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging system announced near the end of the semester. Students are required to complete Part 1 to an acceptable score (specifics TBA later), and complete Part 2 to an acceptable score as well.
