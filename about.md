## About

The Codebreaking at Cal DeCal is designed to provide an introduction to the field of cryptography. This course will focus on real-world examples to teach the mathematics and computer science behind the field. Students will develop both practical and theoretical skills to approach a wide variety of cryptographic challenges in the labs.

## Grading
Grading will be done as follows: 40% Lecture, 60% Labs. Students must receive **70%** to pass. Further details may be found below. The course is worth 2 units, pass / no-pass.

NOTE: We really don't want to NP anyone who puts in effort. Reach out to staff if you are having trouble or want extensions!

## Lecture

Lecture attendance is vital to learning the material and forms 40% of the student's final grade. Lecture will be once a week at **6:30 - 8:00 PM**, in-person at **Soda 306** and webcast.

Each lecture attended counts towards 10% of total lecture attendance (4% overall score), so only 10 lectures are needed to get full credit for this section.

## Resources

Each lecture will have corresponding written notes to explore the material more in-depth than the lecture alone. These are intended to be a theoretical resource to complement the applied nature of the course and are not required reading.

## Assignments

Assignments for this class will consist of weekly labs. Labs in total will form 60% of the student's final grade, and are graded on completion (autograded).

Students must complete **10** labs for full credit. Each missed lab below 10 will incur a 20% overall penalty to the lab section (or 12% overall score), meaning you can miss at most 6 labs out of 14 with perfect attendance.
