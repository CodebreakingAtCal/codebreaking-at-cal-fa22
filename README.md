# Codebreaking at Cal

Welcome to the Fall 2022 iteration of Codebreaking At Cal! This course focuses on cryptography's application to real-world scenarios, and how to break various encryption schemes. 

We are scheduled to have lecture once weekly on Tuesday 6:30 - 8 PM in Soda 306.

Unfortunately, we are no longer accepting applications for Fall.
