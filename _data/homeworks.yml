# Instructions for updating website #

# Written HW filepaths are all formatted based on the HW number.
# Pad HW numbers, e.g. HW2 uses "02", not "2".
# For example, the files for written HW2 should be placed at:
#   - assets/homeworks/hw02.pdf
#   - assets/homeworks/hw02-sols.pdf

# To upload homework to the website:
# 1. In this file, add the link to the electronic Gradescope assignment.
# 2. Put the files in assets/homeworks using the filenames above.

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a homework.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a blank box), add
# "nonumber: True" as an attribute.
