# Final Project

Welcome to the Codebreaking at Cal Final Project! This project aims to 
demonstrate how all the cryptography we covered throughout the semester comes together in real-world applications.

Part 1 will involve building the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol alongside a basic login syste. 

Part 2 will involve a myriad of challenges to solve! Each 
challenge will use a staff version of the aforemention TLS server, but with one fatal security flaw. Your goal is to find this flaw and use it to hack the user's password! Each will be worth a variable amount of points based on difficulty. More details in the Part 2 page.
