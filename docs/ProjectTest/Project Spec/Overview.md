# Final Project

Codebreaking aims to introduce students to cryptography and cryptanalysis. Now it is time to apply the cyrptographic content of this course to a final project. This project will be equivalent to 3 labs in terms of points. As a result, we will be breaking up the final project over 3 distinct parts. 

# Set Up 

Much like previous labs, each link will lead you to a Jupyter Notebook. Furthermore, links will be posted below each subpart for ease of access. The submissions will be done through Gradescope, requiring download of each subpart after completion.
