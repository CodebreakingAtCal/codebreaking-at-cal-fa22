# Final Project
We will be building an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform like Signal, which provides airtight confidentiality against eavesdroppers. 

In Part 1, you will design 
and code your system from the ground up to conform to a set of requirements. How you do this to entirely up to you! You'll have access to the library of functions 
we've built and used throughout the semester.

In Part 2, you will compete to find and exploit vulnerabilities in other student's submissions (or the staff solution)!

# Set Up 

Unlike previous labs which used Jupyter Notebooks, this project will be done locally. Please clone the respository (TODO) to get started.
