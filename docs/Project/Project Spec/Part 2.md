# Final Project: Part 2

Welcome to Part 2! You can find documentation for the challenges in the subfolder below this, or visit all the notebooks [here](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCodebreakingAtCal%2FCodebreakingLabs&urlpath=tree%2FCodebreakingLabs%2FFinal_Project%2FPart_2&branch=master).

In each challenge, you will exploit a security flaw in the underlying system (the TLS handshake / server we built in Part 1). Once you recover the password, you will submit it to Gradescope alongside an explanation of what you did to find it. **Please do not access any 
of the Client/Server private variables like SHARED_SECRET_INT. It ruins the challenge and you won't get any credit. Just use the resources 
given to you.**

Each challenge is of variable difficulty, from the following categories:

Difficulty: <span style="color:green">●</span>
- The first level of difficulty. These challenges should be doable in only a handful of lines of code, by exploiting a glaring flaw. Worth **1/3** a week of lab credit.

Difficulty: <span style="color:#F9DB24">●●</span>
- The second level of difficulty. These challenges might involve a fair bit of coding (especially for Intercept-style ones), but nothing too bad. They will require solid understanding of the underlying system to exploit a less-obvious flaw. Worth **2/3** a week of lab credit.

Difficulty: <span style="color:red">●●●</span>
- The third level of difficulty. These exploits will take significant fundamental understanding of cryptography and the underlying system to identify and utilize. The amount of coding required will still be around the second difficulty level at most. Worth **1 week** of lab **or** attendance credit.

Difficulty: <span style="color:000000">●●●●●</span>
- The final level of difficulty. These security flaws are extremely difficult to find, let alone exploit. Make sure you are comfortable with 
all challenges prior to this before attempting. If you do succeed, a massive congratulations to you! Worth **3 weeks** of lab **or** attendance credit.
