# Final Project

Codebreaking aims to introduce students to cryptography and cryptanalysis. Now it is time to apply the cyrptographic content of this course to a final project!

# Set Up 

Much like previous labs, each link will lead you to a Jupyter Notebook. Furthermore, links will be posted below each subpart for ease of access. The submissions will be done through Gradescope, requiring download of each subpart after completion. 

## Get Started

You can start Part 1 here: [Part 1 Docs](https://codebreakingatcal.org/docs/ProjectTest/Project%20Spec/Part%201/)

The jupyter notebook link is here: [Project Link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCodebreakingAtCal%2FCodebreakingLabs&urlpath=tree%2FCodebreakingLabs%2FFinal_Project%2FPart_1%2Fproject.ipynb&branch=master)
