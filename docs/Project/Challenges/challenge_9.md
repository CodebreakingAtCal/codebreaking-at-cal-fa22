Welcome to the 9th and final challenge! Challenge 9 is **extremely** hard relative to the previous ones, so please complete those first if you have not. 

If you have, congratulations! Completing challenges 1-8 is already very impressive.

This one is quite tricky to figure out, but does not require large amounts of computing power or brute force.

**No modification has been made to the base code. Find the vulnerability that has been hidden the entire time, and use it to 
recover the user's password.**
