# Challenge 5
**Difficulty: <span style="color:#F9DB24">●●</span>**

**Link:** <a href="https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCodebreakingAtCal%2FCodebreakingLabs&urlpath=tree%2FCodebreakingLabs%2FFinal_Project%2FPart_2%2FChallenge_5%2Fchallenge-student.ipynb&branch=master">Jupyter Notebook</a>

Welcome to the 5th challenge!

You've managed to leak the server's old RSA private key and certificate. However, they detected this and switched to a new one. They also fixed 
the issue from Challenge 4.

Similarly to Challenge 4, you will be taking on the role of an active attacker by implementing an Interceptor class.

Recover the user's password.

<details>
    <summary>HINT</summary>
    Is the old certificate necessarily invalid?
</details>

### Submission

Once you've recovered the password, enter it into the Gradescope page [here](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/406561/assignments/2458792) and copy-paste your **Interceptor** class in the same assignment.
